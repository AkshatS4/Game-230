INSTRUCTIONS:

-Press 'F' to change brush type between square and circle.
-Use arrow keys(Up and Down) to change the brush size by +/- 4 pixels.
-Press 'Enter' to take a screenshot.
-Press 'R' for red color brush, 'B' for blue color brush and 'G' for green color brush. By deafult, square brush is red and circle is green.
 
Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out  the eraser so I hope you well in one go:)
